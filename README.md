# RTGCG Math Logic Demonstration

This project demonstrates a simplified implementation of the Recursive Temporal Gaussian Cognitive Graph (RTGCG) architecture, focused on training the system on mathematical logic. RTGCG is a novel cognitive architecture that encodes procedural intelligence as a field of self-referential computational processes embedded in time.

## Overview

The RTGCG architecture treats time as a causal substrate for computation, learning, and identity. Each conceptual unit is represented as a time-evolving probabilistic field using Gaussian embeddings. The system features strange loops and infinitely recursive learning layers, developing chaotic, non-linear internal structures through temporal causality.

In this demonstration, we simulate key aspects of RTGCG applied to mathematical logic, including:
- Temporal evolution of logical concepts
- Gaussian embeddings for probabilistic representation
- Recursive self-referential learning structures
- Time-dependent reasoning and state transformations

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Entry point for the demonstration, orchestrating the training and simulation.
- `rtgcg/`: Directory containing core RTGCG components.
  - `__init__.py`: Package initialization.
  - `temporal_field.py`: Implementation of time-evolving probabilistic fields.
  - `gaussian_embedding.py`: Gaussian embedding logic for concept representation.
  - `recursive_loop.py`: Self-referential structures and feedback loops.
  - `math_logic.py`: Mathematical logic domain-specific implementations.
- `data/`: Directory for storing training data related to mathematical logic.
- `models/`: Directory for saving trained models or system states.
- `utils/`: Utility functions for visualization and analysis.

## Setup

1. Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed.
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the demonstration:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Status

This is a work-in-progress demonstration. Future updates will enhance the fidelity of the RTGCG simulation and expand the scope of mathematical logic problems addressed.

## Disclaimer

This implementation is a simplified interpretation of the theoretical RTGCG architecture for demonstration purposes. It does not fully capture the infinite recursion or fractal complexity described in the original concept.
